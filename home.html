      Graduating from Lancaster University in 2014 with a degree in Computer Science, I’ve worked freelance as a website designer throughout uni and since. I’ve worked with sole traders and businesses with offices in multiple countries.

      I'm currently working as a full-stack developer using the following technologies on a daily basis:
      <ul>
        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Postgres</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Automated deployment tools (Jenkins CI / Chef Server / Capistrano)</li>
      </ul>

      Take a look at some of my previous work, personal projects, and blog.
