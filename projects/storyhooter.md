[StoryHooter](http://storyhooter.chrispomfret.com/user/new?referred_from=692bac7079) was created as an interesting word game and partly as a technical exercise. The premise is based on word games like Mad Libs where you get to create your own story. I liked the idea but wanted to make something on a larger scale. [StoryHooter](http://storyhooter.chrispomfret.com/user/new?referred_from=692bac7079) allows you to build up a story, a line at a time – Once you’ve added your bit, share your unique code and watch as others add to your story. Unlike other games where there’s only one story, each story will be different and can branch at any moment.

To start your story, [click here](http://storyhooter.chrispomfret.com/user/new?referred_from=692bac7079). Don’t forget to remember your unique profile link and share your story!

To store each users’ segment of the story I used Neo4J, a graph database which allowed each section of text to be linked to the next. I found this to be more performant than using a traditional relational database.
